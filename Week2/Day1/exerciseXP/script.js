 // // 5 + "34" : I think it will be 534 because the 34 is a string because of the quotation marks
 //  so JS will connect it to the 5 and not actually add it
 console.log(5 + "34")

// 5 - "4" : I think it will say 1 because you can not subtract two strings so JS will
// think that the " " were a mistake, and they will ignore it and just subtract.
console.log(5 - "4")

 //    10 % 5: I think that it will be 0 because % shows remainders and 5 goes into 10 evenly
console.log(10 % 5)


// 5 % 10 : It will give the remainder
 console.log(5 % 10)


 //    "Java" + "Script": I think it will say JavaScript
 console.log("Java" + "Script")



 //    " " + " " : maybe it will show an empty space
 console.log(" " + " ")


 //    " " + 0 : I think it will show 0 because it will show up as an empty space and then the 0
 console.log(" " + 0)


 //    true + true: I think it will say true bc adding two trues will just remain true. EDIT: it says 2. I guess true=1
 console.log(true + true)


 //    true + false: Maybe it will say 1 bc if true =1 maybe false=0
 console.log(true + false)


 //    false + true: I think it will also say 1
 console.log(false + true)


 //    false - true: Maybe it will say -1, if the value of false=0 and true=1
 console.log(false - true)


 //    3 - 4: This will display -1
 console.log (3 - 4)

 //    "Bob" - "bill": Not sure bc a "-" can not be used with strings. Maybe it will show an error message. EDIT: it shows NaN (I forgot about this)
 console.log ("Bob" - "bill")
